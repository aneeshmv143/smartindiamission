                Education refers to the systematic process of gaining knowledge and skills through study and instructions. The role of education in facilitating social and economic progress has long being recognized. It improves functional and analytical ability and thereby opens up opportunities for individuals and also groups to achieve greater access to labor markets and livelihoods. Education is not only an instrument of enhancing efficiency but is also an effective tool of widening and augmenting democratic participation and upgrading the overall quality of individual and societal life. In India, the emphasis has been on general education, with vocational education at the receiving end, which has resulted in a large number of educated people remaining unemployed.

                Skills and knowledge are the engines of economic and social development of any country. India is in transition to a knowledge based economy and its competitive edge will be determined by the abilities of its people to create, share and use knowledge more effectively. The transition will require India to develop workers into knowledge workers who will be more flexible, analytical, and adaptable and multi skilled. To achieve these goals India need flexible education and training system that will provide the foundation for learning secondary and tertiary education and to develop required competencies.

                Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children between the ages of 6 and 14. With this, India has made progress in terms of increasing the primary education attendance rate and expanding literacy to approximately three-quarters of the population in the 7–10 age groups, by 2011. While enrolment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio of 24% in 2013, there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations, a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.
